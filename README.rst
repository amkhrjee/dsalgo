Data Structures & Algorithms
---------------------------

This repo works as a store-house for implementations of fundamental data structures & algorithms.

This also works as my go-to repo for storing and revisiting my solutions to algorithms problems that I solve for fun or preparing for some interview.

In case you are wondering, here is my leetcode: https://leetcode.com/u/amkhrjee/ 

How to Test?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I am using ``pytest`` for testing. Simply run the following to test everything:

::
pytest -q algorithms/* data_structures/*
